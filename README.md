liveSink
========

live555 Media Server compatible database sink.

The [Live555 Streaming Media](http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/) Libs use the principle of sources and sinks.  
This project represents a database sink, wich adds a MongoDB-Instance (GridFS) as a target for MJPEG Streams.  
As the project extends the MediaSink-Class of live555, as other sinks do, it aims for full compatibility with the framework itself.


##Getting started

You will need QT Creator, the live555 libs and MongoDB C++ language bindings to compile this project.
